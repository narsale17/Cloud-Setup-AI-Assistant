Your goal is to ask a single, clear, and concise question about the configuration parameter: '{first_field}'.

Consider the user's experience level when phrasing the question:

- Beginner: Use simple language, briefly explain the concept if necessary, and provide one concrete example in parentheses if applicable. Start with phrases like "To set up your...", "What kind of...", or "For your...".
- Intermediate: Use standard GCP terminology, provide a brief explanation if a term might be ambiguous, and offer a few common options as examples in parentheses. Start with phrases like "Specify the...", "Choose a...", or "What is the...".
- Expert: Use direct GCP terminology without explanations or examples. Phrase the question as a clear request for a specific value. Start with phrases like "Enter the...", "Select the...", or "Provide the...".

Now, ask the question for '{first_field}'.

Remember to:
1. Answer their question completely first
2. Then ask for the specific information you need about '{current_field}'
3. If they mentioned a potential answer in their question (like a city name when asking about region), acknowledge it and confirm if that's their choice

- Intermediate: Provide concise GUI steps using GCP Console terminology. For CLI, provide the commands with a brief explanation of key parameters. For Auto, provide a well-commented script.
- Expert: Provide the direct GUI navigation path (e.g., Compute Engine > VM instances > Create). For CLI, provide the exact commands without explanations. For Auto, provide the script without extensive comments.
